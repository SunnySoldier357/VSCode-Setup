# Sandeep's VS Code Maven Setup

## Introduction

The script included in the repository installs Maven and
sets up the required environment variables necessary to run
Maven Projects in VS Code. The repository also
automatically detects Java JDKs to use to build Maven
projects. The script finally installs the appropriate
extension in VS Code so the user only has to run the script
and the Java development is setup for VS Code.

## Requirements

The script requires VS Code to already be installed (System
or User) as well as Java. If none of these are installed,
install them before running the script.

## Directions for VS Code
